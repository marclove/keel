## Quote/Mantra
> "We need workloads that developers actually want to deploy to the edge. Show me how this creates applications that are fundamentally better at the edge than in the cloud, and we'll build the best platform for it."

## Keel-Specific Considerations

### Why Keel Appeals to Jennifer:
- **Edge-native architecture**: Designed specifically for edge deployment constraints
- **Performance characteristics**: Single binary deployment reduces cold start latency
- **Developer productivity**: Component reuse accelerates application development
- **Market opportunity**: New category of applications that benefit from edge deployment

### Platform Integration Opportunities:
- **Managed WASI runtime**: Optimized WebAssembly runtime for Keel components
- **Component marketplace**: Platform-hosted registry for discovering and distributing components
- **Development tools**: Integrated debugging, testing, and deployment tools for Keel applications
- **Observability integration**: Built-in monitoring and analytics for component performance

### Strategic Partnership Potential:
- **Co-marketing**: Joint content, conference presentations, and developer outreach
- **Technical integration**: Deep platform integration for optimal Keel deployment experience
- **Ecosystem development**: Joint investment in component developer community
- **Enterprise sales**: Collaborative selling to enterprise customers evaluating edge deployment

### Market Development Strategy:
- **Developer education**: Investment in tutorials, documentation, and developer advocacy
