# Persona: The SaaS Startup Founder

## Demographics
- **Name**: Sarah Chen
- **Age**: 32
- **Location**: San Francisco, CA (remote-first startup)
- **Role**: Co-Founder & CTO
- **Company Stage**: Series A (12 employees, $2M ARR)
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS - Project Management for Creative Teams

## Professional Background
- **Experience**: 8 years in tech (4 years at Google, 2 years at Series B startup, 2 years founding current company)
- **Education**: Computer Science degree from Stanford
- **Technical Skills**: Full-stack development, system architecture, team leadership
- **Previous Projects**: Built and scaled microservices architecture at previous startup from 0 to 50M requests/day

## Goals & Aspirations

### Primary Goals:
- **Speed to Market**: Launch new product features in weeks, not months
- **Competitive Advantage**: Build better, faster products than established competitors
- **Team Efficiency**: Maximize engineering velocity with limited resources
- **Scalable Architecture**: Avoid technical debt that will slow growth at scale

### Long-term Aspirations:
- Scale to $100M ARR within 3 years
- Become the category leader in creative project management
- Build a sustainable, profitable business (not dependent on constant fundraising)
- Create a product that teams actually love using

## Pain Points & Frustrations

### Current Technical Challenges:
- **"Everything is custom"**: Spending 60% of engineering time rebuilding common SaaS components (auth, billing, notifications)
- **Scaling anxiety**: Current monolithic architecture showing stress at 2M ARR - worried about 10M ARR
- **Feature velocity slowing**: Adding new features requires touching multiple services, increasing bugs
- **Infrastructure complexity**: Managing 12 microservices with 2 DevOps engineers
- **Talent competition**: Can't compete with FAANG salaries for senior architects

### Business Pressures:
- **Investor expectations**: Board wants 20% monthly growth with current burn rate
- **Customer demands**: Enterprise prospects requiring SOC 2, GDPR compliance
- **Competitor pressure**: Well-funded competitors launching similar features faster

## Behaviors & Preferences

### Technology Decision Making:
- **Research-heavy**: Reads Hacker News, follows tech Twitter, attends conferences
- **Pragmatic over perfect**: Prefers proven technologies over bleeding edge
- **Team input valued**: Makes technical decisions collaboratively with senior engineers
- **ROI-focused**: Every technology choice evaluated on developer productivity impact

### Information Sources:
- **Primary**: Engineering blogs (Stripe, Shopify, Airbnb engineering blogs)
- **Community**: CTO forums, YC Founder Slack, local tech meetups
- **Learning**: Conference talks, technical podcasts during commute
- **Validation**: Seeks recommendations from other successful founders

### Work Patterns:
- **Deep work**: Blocks 4-hour chunks for architecture planning
- **Hands-on**: Still writes code 2-3 days per week
- **Team leadership**: Daily standups, weekly 1:1s, monthly architecture reviews
- **Strategic thinking**: Quarterly planning sessions with co-founder

## Technology Comfort Level
- **Expert Level**: System design, database architecture, API design
- **Advanced**: Cloud infrastructure (AWS), containerization, CI/CD
- **Learning**: Modern edge computing, WebAssembly, serverless architectures
- **Delegates**: Frontend frameworks (has dedicated frontend team lead)

## Decision-Making Factors

### Must-Haves:
1. **Proven at scale**: Technology must have evidence of handling 100M+ users
2. **Developer productivity**: Must significantly reduce time-to-market
3. **Cost predictability**: Clear understanding of infrastructure costs at scale
4. **Team adoption**: Technology must be learnable by current team

### Nice-to-Haves:
1. **Compliance-ready**: Built-in support for SOC 2, GDPR requirements
2. **Vendor independence**: Not locked into specific cloud provider
3. **Community ecosystem**: Active community, good documentation, examples

### Deal-Breakers:
1. **Experimental technology**: Won't bet company on unproven tech
2. **Vendor lock-in**: Avoids technologies that make migration impossible
3. **High learning curve**: Can't afford 6-month team retraining
4. **Poor documentation**: Won't adopt tools with bad developer experience

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics:
- **Developer velocity**: Feature delivery time reduced by 40%
- **System reliability**: 99.9% uptime maintained during growth
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms API response times globally
- **Infrastructure costs**: Costs grow sub-linearly with user growth

### Business Metrics:
- **Time to market**: New product features shipped in 2-3 weeks vs 2-3 months
- **Customer satisfaction**: NPS score above 50 (currently 34)
- **Engineering efficiency**: 80% of engineering time on features vs infrastructure
- **Compliance readiness**: SOC 2 Type II achieved within 6 months

## Quote/Mantra
> "I need to build enterprise-grade software with a startup budget and timeline. Show me how to deliver customer value faster without compromising on quality or scalability."

## Keel-Specific Considerations

### Why Keel Appeals to Sarah:
- **Composable architecture**: Reuse proven business logic components instead of rebuilding
- **Edge-first design**: Performance benefits align with global customer base
- **Single binary deployment**: Operational simplicity reduces DevOps overhead
- **Hot-swappable components**: Can change providers without code changes

### Potential Objections:
- **WASI Component Model maturity**: Concerned about betting on emerging standard
- **Ecosystem size**: Wants to see more third-party components available
- **Migration path**: Needs clear strategy for migrating existing monolith
- **Team learning curve**: WebAssembly/WASI knowledge gap in current team

### Decision Timeline:
- **Evaluation phase**: 2-3 months of proof-of-concepts and architecture planning
- **Pilot project**: 3-6 months building one new feature with Keel
- **Full adoption**: 6-12 months migration plan if pilot successful
