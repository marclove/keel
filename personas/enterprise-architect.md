## Pain Points & Frustrations

### Technical Challenges:
- **Legacy integration**: 200+ legacy systems with complex interdependencies
- **Compliance complexity**: Every architectural decision requires regulatory approval
- **Vendor lock-in**: Existing contracts with major vendors (IBM, Oracle) limit flexibility
- **Skill gaps**: Workforce trained on legacy technologies, limited cloud-native expertise
- **Performance requirements**: Need to handle 50M+ daily transactions with 99.99% uptime

### Organizational Challenges:
- **Change resistance**: Business units reluctant to change working systems
- **Budget constraints**: $50M digital transformation budget spread across 3 years
- **Regulatory scrutiny**: Every technology change requires months of compliance review
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Balancing needs of risk, compliance, operations, and product teams

## Behaviors & Preferences

### Decision-Making Process:
- **Committee-driven**: Architecture review board with 12 stakeholders
- **Evidence-based**: Requires proof-of-concepts, pilot projects, and vendor references
- **Risk-averse**: Prefers established technologies with enterprise support
- **Long-term thinking**: Architectural decisions evaluated over 5-10 year horizon

### Information Sources:
- **Industry reports**: Gartner, Forrester enterprise architecture research
- **Peer networks**: Enterprise architecture forums, banking technology groups

- **Conferences**: Enterprise architecture conferences, banking technology summits

### Work Patterns:
- **Strategic planning**: Quarterly architecture planning cycles
- **Stakeholder management**: Weekly meetings with business unit leaders
- **Technical oversight**: Monthly reviews of all major technical initiatives
- **Vendor evaluation**: Continuous assessment of emerging technologies

## Technology Comfort Level
- **Expert Level**: Enterprise architecture patterns, integration strategies, governance frameworks
- **Advanced**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), API management, security architecture
- **Learning**: Edge computing, modern deployment patterns, container orchestration
- **Cautious about**: Bleeding-edge technologies, open-source tools without enterprise support

## Decision-Making Factors

### Must-Haves:
1. **Regulatory compliance**: Built-in support for financial services regulations
2. **Enterprise support**: 24/7 support with SLA guarantees from established vendor
3. **Security by design**: Architecture that meets bank-grade security requirements
4. **Proven at scale**: Evidence of successful deployment at similar enterprises
5. **Integration capabilities**: APIs and connectors for existing enterprise systems

### Nice-to-Haves:
1. **Multi-cloud support**: Avoid vendor lock-in with major cloud providers
2. **Developer productivity**: Tools that accelerate application development
3. **Cost optimization**: Technology that reduces total cost of ownership
4. **Future-proofing**: Architecture that adapts to changing business needs

### Deal-Breakers:
1. **Regulatory risk**: Technology that complicates compliance requirements
2. **Vendor stability**: Startups or companies with uncertain long-term viability
3. **Security vulnerabilities**: Architecture that introduces new security risks
4. **Skills gap**: Technology requiring extensive retraining of existing workforce

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics:
- **Migration success**: 80% of legacy systems successfully modernized in 3 years
- **Performance**: Maintain 99.99% uptime during migration
- **Security**: Zero security incidents during transformation
- **Integration**: 95% of new systems integrate through standard APIs

### Business Metrics:
- **Time to market**: New product development reduced from 18 months to 6 months
- **Cost reduction**: Infrastructure costs reduced by 30% over 3 years
- **Compliance**: 100% compliance with regulatory requirements maintained
- **Developer productivity**: 50% increase in application delivery velocity

## Quote/Mantra
> "I need architecture that's innovative enough to transform our business but proven enough to bet our banking license on. Show me how this reduces risk while enabling the innovation our business demands."

## Keel-Specific Considerations

### Why Keel Appeals to David:
- **Compliance-friendly**: Data residency and regional deployment support GDPR requirements
- **Operational simplicity**: Single binary deployment reduces operational risk
- **Proven patterns**: Builds on established architectural concepts (components, interfaces)
- **Vendor independence**: Component model prevents vendor lock-in
- **Gradual migration**: Can adopt incrementally without big-bang transformation

### Potential Objections:
- **Technology maturity**: WASI Component Model still emerging, needs enterprise validation
- **Vendor ecosystem**: Limited number of enterprise-grade component providers
- **Support model**: Needs enterprise support guarantees and SLAs
- **Regulatory approval**: WebAssembly/WASI not yet approved by bank's technology standards

### Decision Timeline:
- **Research phase**: 6-9 months of vendor evaluation and architecture review
- **Proof of concept**: 6-12 months pilot project with non-critical system
- **Limited production**: 12-18 months deployment for specific use case
- **Enterprise adoption**: 2-3 years full integration into technology strategy

### Required Validation:
- **Regulatory approval**: Technology standards committee and compliance review
- **Vendor due diligence**: Financial stability, roadmap, support capabilities
- **Security assessment**: Penetration testing, security architecture review
- **Reference customers**: Successful deployments at other financial institutions
