- **Education**: Bachelor's in Systems Administration, AWS and Kubernetes certifications
- **Technical Skills**: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Docker, monitoring/observability, incident response
- **Current Responsibilities**: Manages infrastructure for 5M+ daily API calls, 50TB data processing, 99.9% SLA

## Goals & Aspirations

### Primary Goals:
- **Operational excellence**: Achieve 99.99% uptime with minimal manual intervention
- **Developer productivity**: Reduce deployment friction, enable self-service for dev teams
- **Cost optimization**: Maintain performance while reducing infrastructure costs
- **Scalability**: Build systems that handle 10x growth without architectural changes

### Long-term Aspirations:
- Become recognized expert in modern deployment patterns and edge computing
- Build internal platform that other companies want to license
- Speak at DevOps conferences about innovative infrastructure patterns
- Lead platform engineering team as company scales to enterprise

## Pain Points & Frustrations

### Current Infrastructure Challenges:
- **Microservices complexity**: Managing 25 services with different deployment patterns
- **Monitoring overhead**: Distributed tracing across services requires complex observability stack
- **Incident response**: Mean time to resolution (MTTR) too high due to service dependencies
- **Resource inefficiency**: Services over-provisioned, leading to 40% waste in cloud spend
- **Developer complaints**: Deployments take 45+ minutes, frequent rollback requests

### Operational Headaches:
- **Alert fatigue**: 200+ alerts per week, 80% false positives
- **Configuration drift**: Services deployed differently across environments
- **Security compliance**: SOC 2 audit requires extensive documentation of all deployments
- **On-call burden**: 3am pages for issues that should be automatically recoverable

## Behaviors & Preferences

### Technology Philosophy:
- **Automation-first**: If it can be automated, it should be automated
- **Observability-driven**: Can't manage what you can't measure
- **Reliability focus**: Prefers boring, proven technologies over shiny new tools
- **Developer empathy**: Optimizes for developer experience while maintaining operational standards

### Problem-Solving Approach:
- **Data-driven**: Uses metrics and logs to diagnose issues, not intuition
- **Systematic**: Documents everything, creates runbooks, builds repeatable processes
- **Prevention-focused**: Prefers preventing problems over fixing them quickly
- **Continuous improvement**: Regular post-mortems, infrastructure retrospectives

### Information Sources:
- **SRE community**: Google SRE books, SRE Weekly newsletter, SREcon talks
- **Platform engineering**: Team Topologies concepts, internal developer platforms
- **Cloud-native**: CNCF projects, Kubernetes community, cloud provider updates
- **Monitoring**: Observability vendors, APM best practices, incident response patterns

## Technology Comfort Level
- **Expert Level**: Kubernetes, AWS, infrastructure as code, monitoring/alerting
- **Advanced**: Container security, service mesh, chaos engineering
- **Learning**: Edge computing, WebAssembly runtimes, modern deployment patterns
- **Cautious about**: Bleeding-edge technologies that lack operational maturity

## Decision-Making Factors

### Must-Haves for New Technology:
1. **Operational simplicity**: Reduces complexity rather than adding it
2. **Observability**: Built-in metrics, logs, traces for debugging
3. **Reliability**: Proven stability under load, graceful failure modes
4. **Security**: Security by design, compliance-ready features
5. **Documentation**: Excellent operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides

### Nice-to-Haves:
1. **Cost efficiency**: Reduces infrastructure costs without sacrificing performance
2. **Developer velocity**: Accelerates development without compromising reliability
3. **Vendor independence**: Avoids lock-in to specific cloud providers
4. **Automation-friendly**: APIs and tooling for infrastructure automation

### Deal-Breakers:
1. **Black box**: Technology that's difficult to debug or troubleshoot
2. **Operational overhead**: Requires significant new operational expertise
3. **Poor scaling**: Performance degrades unpredictably under load
4. **Limited tooling**: Lacks mature ecosystem for monitoring and management

## Success Metrics

### Operational Metrics:
- **Uptime**: 99.99% availability (current: 99.92%)
- **MTTR**: Mean time to resolution under 30 minutes (current: 75 minutes)
- **Deployment success**: 99%+ deployment success rate
- **Alert quality**: <10% false positive rate on critical alerts

### Efficiency Metrics:
- **Infrastructure costs**: 25% reduction in cloud spend per transaction
- **Developer velocity**: Deploy time reduced from 45 minutes to <10 minutes
- **On-call burden**: <2 pages per week outside business hours
- **Automation coverage**: 95% of operational tasks automated

### Business Impact:
- **Customer impact**: Zero customer-facing incidents longer than 5 minutes
- **Developer satisfaction**: 8+ score on internal developer experience surveys
- **Compliance**: 100% audit compliance with minimal manual documentation
- **Scalability**: Support 5x growth without proportional infrastructure cost increase

## Quote/Mantra
> "I want infrastructure that's boring in the best way - reliable, predictable, and invisible to developers. Show me how this makes operations simpler, not more complex."

## Keel-Specific Considerations

### Why Keel Appeals to Maria:
- **Operational simplicity**: Single binary deployment eliminates service mesh complexity
- **Reduced attack surface**: Fewer moving parts mean fewer security vulnerabilities
- **Debugging advantages**: Function calls instead of network calls simplify troubleshooting
- **Resource efficiency**: Better resource utilization compared to microservices
- **Compliance-friendly**: Data residency controls built into architecture

### Implementation Concerns:
- **Monitoring strategy**: How to observe component interactions within single process
- **Deployment patterns**: Rolling updates, canary deployments with single binary
- **Resource allocation**: Memory and CPU allocation across components
- **Scaling patterns**: Horizontal scaling strategies for edge deployments

### Operational Requirements:
- **Health checks**: Component-level health monitoring
- **Metrics collection**: Performance metrics for each component
- **Log aggregation**: Structured logging from all components
- **Alerting**: Component-specific alerting without alert fatigue
- **Backup/recovery**: Data backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Pilot project**: Deploy non-critical service to evaluate operational characteristics
- **Performance testing**: Load testing to understand scaling behavior
- **Monitoring integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing observability stack
- **Documentation quality**: Operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides
- **Community support**: Access to experienced operators for knowledge sharing

### Expected Timeline:
- **Learning phase**: 1-2 months understanding WASI runtime operational characteristics
- **Proof of concept**: 2-3 months deploying and monitoring pilot service
- **Production evaluation**: 3-6 months evaluating operational metrics and team feedback
- **Migration planning**: 6+ months developing migration strategy for existing services
