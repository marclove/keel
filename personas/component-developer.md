2. **Discovery platform**: Marketplace or registry for component visibility
3. **Community**: Active ecosystem of developers building and sharing components
4. **Enterprise adoption**: Large companies using and validating components

### Deal-Breakers:
1. **Vendor lock-in**: Platform that restricts distribution or licensing
2. **Poor tooling**: Difficult development experience or debugging capabilities
3. **Limited adoption**: Technology without clear path to widespread usage
4. **Frequent breaking changes**: Platform instability affecting component compatibility

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics:
- **Component adoption**: 10,000+ downloads per month for main components
- **Performance**: Components perform in top 10% of benchmark comparisons
- **Reliability**: <0.1% bug report rate, 99%+ uptime for hosted components
- **Developer satisfaction**: 4.5+ star ratings on component registry

### Business Metrics:
- **Revenue**: $8K+ monthly recurring revenue from component licensing/support
- **Consulting demand**: 30+ hours/week of high-value consulting opportunities
- **Industry recognition**: Speaking invitations, blog post syndication
- **Network growth**: 5,000+ Twitter followers, 10,000+ GitHub stars across projects

## Quote/Mantra
> "I want to build components so good that developers choose them over building their own. The ecosystem succeeds when creators can make a living building high-quality, reusable software."

## Keel-Specific Considerations

### Why Keel Appeals to Alex:
- **Large addressable market**: Every SaaS company is potential user of business domain components
- **Clear value proposition**: Components solve real business problems, not just technical ones
- **Quality standards**: BDD testing and architectural patterns ensure high-quality components
- **Growing ecosystem**: Early opportunity to establish expertise in emerging field

### Component Development Opportunities:
- **Infrastructure adapters**: Database, cache, message queue, storage providers
- **Business domains**: Authentication, billing, notifications, analytics, content management
- **Platform services**: Observability, security, rate limiting, feature flags
- **Developer tools**: Testing frameworks, deployment tools, monitoring dashboards

### Monetization Strategies:
- **Freemium components**: Basic versions free, advanced features paid
- **Support contracts**: Enterprise support for mission-critical components
- **Custom development**: Bespoke components for specific business needs
- **Training/consulting**: Workshops and consulting on component architecture

### Potential Concerns:
- **Market timing**: WASI Component Model adoption timeline uncertain
- **Competition**: Large companies might build competing component ecosystems
- **Standards evolution**: Component interfaces may change, requiring updates
- **Discovery**: Need effective way for potential users to find quality components

### Development Timeline:
- **Learning phase**: 2-3 months mastering WASI Component Model and Keel patterns
