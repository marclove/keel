# Keel: Composable SaaS Architecture

> **Status**: Early development (Phase 1). This project is actively developed and welcomes community contributions.

Keel is a composable SaaS architecture built on the [WASI Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) to create reusable business capabilities. Build multiple SaaS products by composing business domain components, with infrastructure adapters that can be swapped via configuration.

## Spin Framework

We use the [Spin framework](https://spinframework.dev) to build and run event-driven microservice applications composed of WebAssembly (Wasm) components.

- Fast cold starts: Wasm is sandboxed, portable, and fast ‚Äî millisecond cold start times remove the need to keep apps ‚Äúwarm‚Äù.
- Language flexibility: Many languages have Wasm implementations; build components in the language you prefer.
- Open and portable: Spin is open source, under the CNCF, and built on standards, with implementations for local development, self-hosted servers, Kubernetes, and cloud-hosted services.

What Spin enables (non-exhaustive):
- Triggers: HTTP, Redis, Cron, with a simple trigger model for event-driven apps.
- Developer workflow: Creating apps, application structure, building, running, testing, observability, troubleshooting, runtime configuration.
- Feature APIs: Making HTTP requests, Key-Value store, SQLite database, MQTT messaging, Redis storage, relational databases, Serverless AI, variables.

These capabilities let us compose business components and attach the right triggers and platform features at the edges while keeping core logic portable.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/keel.git
cd keel

# One-time setup
just init              # adds wasm target (wasm32-wasip2), installs JS deps
# Or do everything including Spin CLI (Homebrew if available)
just setup

# Build (native or WASM)
just build             # native workspace build
just build-wasm        # wasm32-wasip2 build

# Transpile WASM components to JS (via jco)
just transpile

# Run tests
just test              # workspace tests (unit + BDD)
# or target a single crate
just test-crate sql-sqlite
```

## Spin Quickstart

Spin powers our event-driven Wasm apps. If the Spin CLI is installed and you have a Spin app directory (with `spin.toml`):

```bash
# Check Spin availability and version
just spin-check

# Scaffold a new app (example template)
just spin-new http-rust my-app
cd my-app

# Build and run locally
just spin-build .
just spin-up .

# Watch for changes
just spin-watch .

# Deploy to Fermyon Cloud
just spin-cloud-login
just spin-cloud-deploy .
```

Install Spin: https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/index
Or run `just setup` to install prerequisites and Spin. On Linux, `setup`/`spin-install` will attempt to use your package manager (apt/dnf/yum/pacman/zypper) and the official installer script.
On Windows: run `just spin-install-windows` to see native Windows options; on WSL, use the Linux steps above.

## Architecture Overview

Keel organizes components into layers with clear separation of concerns:

```
Product Layer        ‚Üí Complete SaaS applications
Business Domain      ‚Üí Reusable business capabilities
Repository Layer     ‚Üí Abstract data operations
Platform Services    ‚Üí Cross-cutting concerns
Infrastructure       ‚Üí Provider-specific adapters
```

Each layer uses WIT interfaces for strong contracts and hot-swappable implementations.

## Key Benefits

- **üöÄ Rapid Development**: Build new SaaS products in weeks, not months
- **üîÑ Hot-Swappable**: Change providers via configuration (PostgreSQL ‚Üí SQLite)
- **üì¶ Edge-Native**: Single binary deployment to edge locations worldwide
- **üåê Language Agnostic**: Components in Rust, Go, Python, or any WASI language
- **üß™ Test-Driven**: Comprehensive BDD testing at every layer
- **üèóÔ∏è Team Autonomy**: Independent component development with interface contracts

## Example: Email Service

```rust
// Business logic - no database or provider details
impl EmailService {
    fn send_welcome_email(email: String) -> Result<MessageId> {
        // Abstract business operations
        let user = user_repository::find_by_email(&email)?;
        let template = template_repository::get_template("welcome")?;

        // Platform services
        rate_limiting::check_limit(&user.id)?;

        // Infrastructure abstraction
        email_provider::send(user.email, template.render(user))?;

        Ok(message_id)
    }
}
```

Configuration determines implementation:
```toml
[infrastructure]
sql = "sql-sqlite.wasm"     # or "sql-postgres.wasm"
email = "email-sendgrid.wasm" # or "email-mailgun.wasm"

[repositories]
user-repository = "user-repository.wasm"
template-repository = "template-repository.wasm"
```

### Deployment Targets

In addition to generic Spin-compatible runtimes, we consider leveraging the following to accelerate delivery:
- [Fermyon Cloud](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud/index) ‚Äî managed hosting for Spin applications.
- [Fermyon Wasm Functions](https://developer.fermyon.com/wasm-functions/index) ‚Äî function-level deployments that map well to Spin‚Äôs event-driven model.

These options provide much of the desired operational functionality out of the box and may help us get to market faster.

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (Foundation)** - In Progress:
- ‚úÖ Project structure and WIT interfaces
- ‚úÖ BDD testing framework
- ‚úÖ Basic SQL and KV components
- üöß SQLite and RocksDB integration
**Phase 3 (Platform Services)** - Next: Cross-cutting concerns (observability, security, rate-limiting)
**Phase 3 (Platform Services)** - Cross-cutting concerns (observability, security, rate-limiting)

See the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for upcoming phases and target dates.
