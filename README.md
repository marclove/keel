# Keel: Composable SaaS Architecture

> **Status**: Early development (Phase 1). This project is actively developed and welcomes community contributions.

Keel is a composable SaaS architecture built on the [WASI Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) to create reusable business capabilities. Build multiple SaaS products by composing business domain components, with infrastructure adapters that can be swapped via configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/keel.git
cd keel

# One-time setup
just init              # adds wasm target (wasm32-wasip2), installs JS deps

# Build (native or WASM)
just build             # native workspace build
just build-wasm        # wasm32-wasip2 build

# Transpile WASM components to JS (via jco)
just transpile

# Run tests
just test              # workspace tests (unit + BDD)
# or target a single crate
just test-crate sql-sqlite
```

## Architecture Overview

Keel organizes components into layers with clear separation of concerns:

```
Product Layer        ‚Üí Complete SaaS applications
Business Domain      ‚Üí Reusable business capabilities  
Repository Layer     ‚Üí Abstract data operations
Platform Services    ‚Üí Cross-cutting concerns
Infrastructure       ‚Üí Provider-specific adapters
```

Each layer uses WIT interfaces for strong contracts and hot-swappable implementations.

## Key Benefits

- **üöÄ Rapid Development**: Build new SaaS products in weeks, not months
- **üîÑ Hot-Swappable**: Change providers via configuration (PostgreSQL ‚Üí SQLite)
- **üì¶ Edge-Native**: Single binary deployment to edge locations worldwide  
- **üåê Language Agnostic**: Components in Rust, Go, Python, or any WASI language
- **üß™ Test-Driven**: Comprehensive BDD testing at every layer
- **üèóÔ∏è Team Autonomy**: Independent component development with interface contracts

## Example: Email Service

```rust
// Business logic - no database or provider details
impl EmailService {
    fn send_welcome_email(email: String) -> Result<MessageId> {
        // Abstract business operations
        let user = user_repository::find_by_email(&email)?;
        let template = template_repository::get_template("welcome")?;
        
        // Platform services  
        rate_limiting::check_limit(&user.id)?;
        
        // Infrastructure abstraction
        email_provider::send(user.email, template.render(user))?;
        
        Ok(message_id)
    }
}
```

Configuration determines implementation:
```toml
[infrastructure]
sql = "sql-postgres.wasm"     # or "sql-sqlite.wasm" 
email = "email-sendgrid.wasm" # or "email-mailgun.wasm"

[repositories]  
user-repository = "user-repository.wasm"
template-repository = "template-repository.wasm"
```
