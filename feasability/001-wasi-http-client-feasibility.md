# Feasibility Report 001: WASI HTTP Client Components

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Status**: Feasible (Production Ready)  
**Assessment**: Technical feasibility for HTTP client functionality in WASI 0.2 components  
**Confidence Level**: High  

## Context

Keel's composable SaaS architecture requires components to make outbound HTTP requests for:
- External API integrations (payment processors, email services)
- Inter-service communication in distributed deployments
- Third-party service consumption (analytics, monitoring)
- Webhook delivery and external notifications

The question arose whether WASI 0.2 Component Model provides sufficient HTTP client capabilities for production use in August 2025.

## Technical Assessment

### Current State Analysis

**WASI HTTP Specification Status**:
- **Phase**: Phase 3 (Implementation)
- **Stability**: Stable since WASI 0.2.0 (January 2024)
- **Runtime Support**: Production-ready in wasmtime, available in wasmer
- **Interface**: `wasi:http/outgoing-handler` provides full client functionality

**Verified Capabilities**:
- Complete HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH)
- Multi-protocol support (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3) via protocol abstraction
- Request/response streaming with trailer support
- Comprehensive header manipulation
- Robust error handling (DNS, TLS, connection, protocol errors)
- Request timeout configuration

**Production Evidence**:
- Adobe uses WASI HTTP components for C2PA implementation
- Fermyon operates Spin applications (WASI HTTP) in production since 2022
- wasmtime serves as reference implementation with active production deployments

### Performance Characteristics

**Current Performance Profile**:
- **Latency Overhead**: ~10x slower than native HTTP clients
- **Root Cause**: Integration with tokio runtime adds serialization overhead
- **Baseline**: Still suitable for most SaaS integration patterns
- **Improvement Timeline**: WASI 0.3 (November 2025) targets performance optimizations

**Scaling Considerations**:
- Single-threaded execution model per component instance
- No parallel HTTP requests within same component
- Concurrent requests require multiple component instances

### Technical Constraints

**WASI 0.2 Limitations**:
1. **Async Model**: Polling-based async complicates component composition
2. **Single Stream Access**: HTTP body streams retrievable only once
3. **World Restrictions**: `wasi:http/proxy` world excludes filesystem/direct network APIs
4. **Language Import Issues**: Some languages struggle with `:` and `/` in WIT imports

**Runtime-Specific Considerations**:
- wasmtime provides most mature implementation (recommended)
- wasmer offers WASI 0.2 support but less comprehensive
- Component Model tooling best supported in Rust ecosystem

## Feasibility Verdict

### Go/No-Go Decision: **GO** âœ…

**Rationale**: Production-ready technology with active deployments and stable specification.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality proven in production
- **Medium Risk**: Performance overhead may require optimization strategies
- **Mitigation**: Performance improvements planned for WASI 0.3

### Implementation Strategy

**Immediate Approach (August 2025)**:
1. **Primary Runtime**: wasmtime for most mature HTTP implementation
2. **Component Design**: Target `wasi:http/proxy` world for HTTP-focused components
3. **Language Choice**: Rust with `cargo-component` for best tooling support
4. **Performance Planning**: Account for 10x overhead in capacity planning

**Code Integration Pattern**:
```rust
// WIT imports
use wasi::http::outgoing_handler;
use wasi::http::types::*;

// Implementation pattern
impl HttpClient {
    fn make_request(&self, url: &str) -> Result<Response, HttpError> {
        let request = OutgoingRequest::new(Headers::new());
        request.set_method(&Method::GET);
        request.set_scheme(&Scheme::HTTPS);
        // ... configure request
        
        let future_response = outgoing_handler::handle(request, None)?;
        future_response.get()
    }
}
```

**Deployment Strategies**:
- **Native WASM**: Direct deployment to wasmtime-based platforms
- **JavaScript Transpilation**: Use `jco` for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- **Hybrid Approach**: Component composition with host-provided HTTP for performance-critical paths

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### If Direct HTTP Proves Insufficient

1. **Host Function Delegation**: Implement HTTP as custom host functions
   - **Pros**: Maximum performance, full control
   - **Cons**: Breaks component portability, increases coupling

2. **WASIX Extensions**: Leverage wasmer's WASIX for additional networking
   - **Pros**: Broader networking capabilities
   - **Cons**: Runtime lock-in, non-standard approach

3. **Message Queue Pattern**: Async HTTP via message passing
   - **Pros**: Decouples components from direct HTTP concerns
   - **Cons**: Increases architectural complexity

## Future Trajectory

**WASI 0.3 Improvements (November 2025)**:
- Native async/await support
- Improved component composition for concurrent I/O
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced streaming capabilities

**Long-term Evolution (2026+)**:
- WASI 1.0 standardization
- Broader runtime ecosystem adoption
- Performance parity with native implementations

## Recommendations

### For Keel Architecture

1. **Proceed with WASI HTTP implementation** - technology is production-ready
2. **Design components with performance constraints in mind** - plan for 10x overhead
3. **Establish performance baselines** - measure actual impact in your use cases
4. **Monitor WASI 0.3 development** - prepare for async improvements
5. **Consider hybrid deployment strategies** - leverage both WASM and JS transpilation

### Development Priorities

1. **Start with simple HTTP clients** - prove the pattern before complex integrations
2. **Build performance testing into CI** - catch regressions early
3. **Document component HTTP patterns** - establish team conventions
4. **Plan migration path to WASI 0.3** - prepare for async improvements

## Conclusion

WASI 0.2 HTTP client functionality is **technically feasible and recommended for production use** in Keel's component architecture. While performance overhead exists, the maturity of the specification, active production deployments, and upcoming improvements in WASI 0.3 make this a sound technical foundation.

The primary trade-off is accepting current performance limitations in exchange for component portability, standardized interfaces, and future-proofing against the evolving WASI ecosystem.
