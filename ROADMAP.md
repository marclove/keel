# Keel Roadmap

> **Status**: This roadmap is actively maintained and updated as the project evolves. The Keel project is in early development (Phase 1).

This roadmap outlines the planned development phases for the Keel composable SaaS architecture. Like the [WASI roadmap](https://wasi.dev/), our development is milestone-driven with incremental deliveries.

## Current Milestone: Foundation (Phase 1)

**Goal**: Establish the core component model architecture and prove it works with real databases.

### Completed
- [x] Project structure and Cargo workspace setup
- [x] BDD testing framework using cucumber-rs
- [x] Generic WIT interfaces for `sql` and `kv` adapters
- [x] Component compilation and WIT binding generation
- [x] SQLite and RocksDB integration as test dependencies
- [x] Architecture documentation and roadmap

### In Progress
- [ ] Real SQLite integration in BDD tests
- [ ] Complete sql-sqlite component implementation
- [ ] Complete kv-rocksdb component implementation

### Target Completion
Foundation Phase complete with working infrastructure adapters.

---

## Next Milestone: Infrastructure Layer (Phase 2)

**Goal**: Complete infrastructure adapter ecosystem with multiple provider options.

### Planned Components

#### SQL Adapters
- [ ] `sql-sqlite` - SQLite database adapter (in progress)
- [ ] `sql-postgres` - PostgreSQL database adapter
- [ ] `sql-mysql` - MySQL database adapter

#### Key-Value Adapters
- [ ] `kv-rocksdb` - RocksDB adapter (in progress)
- [ ] `kv-redis` - Redis adapter
- [ ] `kv-memory` - In-memory adapter for testing

#### Communication Adapters
- [ ] `email-sendgrid` - SendGrid email provider
- [ ] `email-mailgun` - Mailgun email provider
- [ ] `email-ses` - AWS SES email provider

#### Authentication Adapters
- [ ] `auth-okta` - Okta authentication provider
- [ ] `auth-auth0` - Auth0 authentication provider
- [ ] `auth-local` - Local authentication for development

### Success Criteria
- All adapters pass comprehensive BDD test suites
- Hot-swapping between providers works via configuration
- Components compile to efficient WASM modules (<1MB each)
- Documentation and examples for each adapter

### Target Completion
Complete infrastructure adapter ecosystem.

---

## Future Milestone: Platform Services Layer (Phase 3)

**Goal**: Cross-cutting concerns that provide observability, security, and operational capabilities.

### Planned Components

#### Observability
- [ ] `observability` - Unified tracing, metrics, and logging
  - Integration with OpenTelemetry standards
  - Support for multiple backends (Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.)

#### Security & Compliance
- [ ] `security-context` - Authentication, authorization, and audit
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Audit logging and compliance reporting
- [ ] `rate-limiting` - Request throttling and abuse prevention

#### Operational
- [ ] `feature-flags` - A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- [ ] `configuration` - Dynamic configuration management

### Success Criteria
- Platform services integrate seamlessly with business components
- Security auditing meets compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Observability provides production-ready monitoring
- Feature flags enable safe deployments

### Target Completion
Production-ready platform services.

---

## Future Milestone: Repository Layer (Phase 4)

**Goal**: Abstract business data operations away from infrastructure concerns.

### Planned Components

#### Core Repositories
- [ ] `user-repository` - User management and profiles
- [ ] `workspace-repository` - Multi-tenant workspace data
- [ ] `template-repository` - Email and notification templates
- [ ] `billing-repository` - Subscription and usage data

### WIT Interface Design
Each repository will expose business-domain operations:

```wit
interface user-repository {
    // Business operations, not SQL
    find-by-email: func(email: string) -> result<user, user-error>
    create-user: func(registration: user-registration) -> result<user-id, user-error>
    update-preferences: func(user-id: user-id, prefs: user-preferences) -> result<_, user-error>
    deactivate-user: func(user-id: user-id, reason: deactivation-reason) -> result<_, user-error>
}
```

### Success Criteria
- Business logic contains zero SQL strings or database-specific code
- Repositories are database-agnostic (work with any SQL adapter)
- Comprehensive test coverage with both real and mock databases
- Performance benchmarks meet SaaS application requirements

### Target Completion
Complete repository abstraction layer.

---

## Future Milestone: Business Domain Layer (Phase 5)

**Goal**: Reusable business capabilities that can be composed into different SaaS products.

### Core Business Domains

#### Communication & Engagement
- [ ] `email-service` - Transactional and marketing email
- [ ] `notification-orchestration` - Multi-channel notifications
- [ ] `real-time-messaging` - Chat and messaging capabilities

#### User & Workspace Management
- [ ] `user-lifecycle` - Onboarding, activation, retention
- [ ] `workspace-management` - Multi-tenant workspace operations
- [ ] `team-collaboration` - Shared workspaces and permissions

#### Commerce & Billing
- [ ] `subscription-billing` - Recurring subscription management
- [ ] `usage-billing` - Metered usage and billing
- [ ] `payment-processing` - Payment method and transaction handling

#### Content & Media
- [ ] `document-management` - File storage and collaboration
- [ ] `live-streaming` - Video streaming and recording
- [ ] `content-moderation` - Automated and manual content review

### Success Criteria
- Business domains are product-agnostic and reusable
- Each domain has comprehensive API documentation
- Performance meets production SaaS requirements
- Business domains integrate cleanly with platform services

### Target Completion
Core business domain library complete.
